SUMMARY FOR PROVIDER
====================
ISSUE: Network interface takes 7+ minutes to establish link after detection
IMPACT: 
- System boot delayed by 7+ minutes
- Network services fail to start
- DHCP services fail
- System appears unresponsive during boot

EVIDENCE:
- Interface detected immediately (1.5 seconds)
- Interface renamed immediately (1.5 seconds)  
- Link establishment delayed by 455+ seconds (7+ minutes)
- Multiple service timeouts due to delay
- Network services fail to start properly

ROOT CAUSE: Hardware/driver issue causing massive delay between interface 
detection and link establishment. Interface is detected and renamed properly, 
but the actual network link takes 7+ minutes to come up.

RECOMMENDATION: Provider should investigate:
1. PCI device enumeration issues
2. Power management problems
3. Driver initialization delays
4. Hardware compatibility issues
5. BIOS/UEFI network settings

This is a clear hardware/driver issue, not a software configuration problem.
